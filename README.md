# PostHog Plugin

The most recent addition is the PostHog plugin. This allows you to record event data and send it to the Mixpanel analytics service through PostHog. All it should require is to setup the constants in the PostHog autoload singleton script according to your parameters.

Thanks to https://github.com/WolfgangSenff for the initial version.
